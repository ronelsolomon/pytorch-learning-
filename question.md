AI / ML Engineer in 2026, please learn:

One ML stack deeply:-  PyTorch or JAX, not just .fit(), but GPU memory, kernels, mixed precision, profiling, and why your model OOMs at 3am.

Data:- Where it comes from, how it lies, how it drifts, how labels break, how leakage sneaks in, and why 80% of model failures are upstream.

Statistics:-  Bias vs variance, confidence intervals, calibration, distribution shift, and why “95% accuracy” is often meaningless.

Loss functions:- What you are actually optimizing, how it shapes behavior, and how bad losses silently create bad products.

Evaluation:- Real-world metrics, not Kaggle ones. Offline vs online. Regression tests for models. When numbers lie.

Training:- Distributed GPUs, gradient accumulation, checkpointing, reproducibility, and how to not lose a 3-day run to one crash.

LLMs: Tokenization, attention, context limits, KV cache, LoRA vs fine-tuning vs RAG, and where hallucinations are born.

Inference:- Batching, quantization, vLLM, streaming, cold starts, GPU vs. CPU, and why serving is harder than training.

Retrieval:- Embeddings, chunking, hybrid search, reranking, grounding, and why most RAG systems fail quietly.

Pipelines:- Feature stores, offline vs. online data, backfills, late events, schema evolution, and broken joins.

Monitoring:- Drift, outliers, token spend, latency, hallucination rate, and silent quality decay.

Optimization:-  Distillation, pruning, caching, prompt compression, and how to make models affordable.

Agents:- Tool calling, memory, retries, failure modes, and why autonomous systems are chaos engines.

Security:- Prompt injection, data exfiltration, training data leaks, and tool misuse.

Deployment:- Model versioning, shadow runs, canaries, rollbacks, and killing bad models fast.

Distributed systems:- Queues, retries, idempotency, backpressure, and partial failures. ML is just distributed systems with gradients.

Documentation:- Model cards, data contracts, eval reports, and written tradeoffs.

Pick one stack. Build real systems. Break them. Fix them.
